## Introduction

What is a Regression Problem? A Regression Problem is when an output/target variable is real or continuous value. Regression is supervised machine learning technique which is used in prediction of these continuous variables such as height, salary & house priceðŸ˜‰ too.

So what exactly we are trying to do? We are trying to : Predict a Target Using some features

Now let's come to the competion problem statement


## Challenge Objectives
In context of the details shared above via the Project Background, in this challenge we are looking to introduce a straightforward regression practice problem.

The dataset has been shared in the challenge forum. There are 45 features in the dataset, and one regression label (i.e. it's a single-label prediction challenge, not multi-label)

Within this goal the following are the targets:

Train a model, using the file train.csv - The train.csv file can be found in the challenge dataset folder in the forum. That file should be used to train a machine learning model. Here the last (right-most) column in the file is the label, and all other columns are features
Using the trained model, predict regression labels for test_x.csv - The test_x.csv file contains the test dataset. It does NOT contain the labels, and hence the regression labels need to be predicted.
