    "What is a Regression Problem? A Regression Problem is when an output/target variable is real or continuous value. Regression is supervised machine learning technique which is used in prediction of these continuous variables such as height, salary & house priceüòâ too.\n",

    "So what exactly we are trying to do? We are trying to : Predict a Target Using some features\n",

    "## Challenge Objectives\n",
    "In context of the details shared above via the Project Background, in this challenge we are looking to introduce a straightforward regression practice problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has been shared in the challenge forum. There are 45 features in the dataset, and one regression label (i.e. it's a single-label prediction challenge, not multi-label)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this goal the following are the targets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a model, using the file train.csv - The train.csv file can be found in the challenge dataset folder in the forum. That file should be used to train a machine learning model. Here the last (right-most) column in the file is the label, and all other columns are features\n",
    "Using the trained model, predict regression labels for test_x.csv - The test_x.csv file contains the test dataset. It does NOT contain the labels, and hence the regression labels need to be predicted."
